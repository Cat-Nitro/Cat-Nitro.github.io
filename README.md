# Cat-Nitro Original Contributer:
(yes that is spelled right i pwomise :3

OG Cat-Nitro, or Pepsi Nitro was originally created by Dr Doomsday (who coincidentally creates discord meme yt shorts and makes thousands of dollars a month maybe ill try that)

He created pepsi nitro, then *moved* the repository, in which he stoped updating it. I stepped in, rebranded it, and now commit (usually) weekly updates or quick bug fixes. Mr. Doomsday, for uknown reasons, deleted the original repository. Leaving this website one of the only forks that remained standing. Most design and color pallet choice credit goes to him. However i have been addig more games and archives.
