    <p1 style="color: limegreen;">Hello, Internet! Because making a browser ds emulator from scratch is too hard, i've decided to let you guys use what i personally use: Desume! This is a LOCAL program which means you need to do special stuff to launch it. You must drag the .exe file over the .bat file named "desume-run.bat". It should launch. In the Desume files, there will be a folder called "roms" these folders contain Pokemon Platinum, nintendogs, and pokemon white.</p1>
