You are a skid. A skid is someone who takes another's hard work, and uses it for their own purposes, and calls it their own. You have shown GREAT ignorance and stupidity. I feel kind of stupid for trying to teach you anything about HTML.
I wanted to see you create your OWN projects and have fun creating something that was your own. You might say that because the skeleton for Cat-Nitro was forked from another website, that it's not my own. Here's the thing, first of all, the owner deleted it and stopped working on it. Secondly, i've contributed enough changes to call it my own rather than just changing the picture and the headers.
Anyways, You completley violated the MIT license (which you can view here) [https://opensource.org/license/mit], which strictly prohibits the use of the intelectual property from being used or copied without the MIT license being used.
You delted my license, changed it to whatever the hell you have on there now, and then, you even had the AUDACITY to fork it to an alt account, all so my name wasnt attached to it at all. You disgust me, you truly do.
I do not wish to see you or talk to you from now on. I will try my best not to look at you, but i cant makw any promises. 

You not only copied my work, removed all conection to me, but you also had the steel balls to become my friend, talk to me, and even get me to help you.

This is my intelectual property you stole. From which I will not forgive. 

You are a skid, and that will most likley never change.
